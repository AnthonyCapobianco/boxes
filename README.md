# boxes (alpha 0.0.1)

This project provides an easy way for users to create boxes to surround their text. 

This is a proof of concept. This release is an alpha version and makes heavy use of `#define` preprocessor macros.

Please don't use this as-is in your projects. 

Although it is stable while used alone, boxes hasen't been exensively tested. 

No, really. This is an alpha release for "$#!_ and giggles" nothing more.
